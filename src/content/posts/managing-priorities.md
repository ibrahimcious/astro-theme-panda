### **What is Adulting?**

If we check the Merriam-Webster dictionary website, we can find that adulting is :

> the act or practice of attending to the ordinary tasks required of a
> responsible adult

I learned the hard way by being an adult myself to find out the the simple explanation of being an adult is **responsibility**. 

**Why Responsibility?**

Let's take a step back to our life as kids or teenagers. We, as kids, primarily only have one responsibility, which is studying. We can play video games, or watch tv shows, but when it's time to study, we must study. 
Responsibility is added when we start to work. Besides our personal life, we must be responsible for our jobs. The simple explanation is, we can't watch tv shows all the night because we can't be late for work in the morning. It means we should manage the priorities between personal life and job.
Things get more complex when we get married. We should think about our personal life, job, and our partner. It's tougher when we have childrens as we have more responsibilities.


**Manage Responsibility**

I know we want it all at the same time. For an example, when I play video games, I want the house to be clean too. But it is impossible in certain situations because ***there will be consequencesforf what we do***.  Let's say, if I have more money to hire a maid, I can play video games and let the maid clean the house. It means I should have more money. What about if I don't have money? Well, it means I should reduce the time spent playing video games and spend the rest of the time cleaning the house.

The complexity is higher when we have children. If I were the CEO for a big company I would hire a babysitter to take care of my child, the consequences is maybe I won't have much time with my child. If I were an ordinary person with 9-to-5 jobs and average income, I can't hire a babysitter and I let my wife to take care of my child at home. The consequences is my wife doesn't work and my family income is not increased, which will create another consequences. 

**What I've Learned so Far**

I've learned to manage priorities. considering the consequences of different choices. In my experience, I love learning something new. Right now, I'm learning to develop a website so I can make a cool website. What are the requirements of this? **Time and money**. 
My job is in government institution with working hours from 7 am to 3 pm. After I get home, there's family time - playing with my daughter, talking with my wife, dinner outside, etc. Let's say until 9 pm before going to bed. Maybe I can study at night before going to sleep, but I'm too tired. So, I study after I wake up, maybe at 3 am. There's only a 2-hour window for me to stud. This time will be reduced if I wake up late or if my workload is heavy. For this explanation alone, there are 4 priorities I should consider: Myself, my daughter, my wife, my job. Let alone when there are neighborhood activities or other events.

### **Conclusion**

I never expected managing priorities would be so serious. For me, my family is the top priority and myself is the last. I know I'm not perfect because sometimes I feel tired too and sometimes I feel like I should have some me-time too. It doesn't mean I have no priority at all for myself, but maybe I just have one or two personal priorities that I can fulfilled. Just because I have bigger responsibilities.

Ah, adult life...
